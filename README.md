# Portafolio Personal

Hi all, 

My name is Alejandra V López Chiquito. I was born on 1992 in Morelia, Michoacán, México.
I'm Systems Computer Engineer and now I'm a student of the Master in Science on Artificial Intelligence at the UAQ (Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro).

This is my personal portfolio of projects and resources. 
You will find complete projects, ideas, testing, etc. using different programming languages such as Python, C, and Matlab.
